# NoA Ignite Coding Test

## Tasks
```
Project idea

Decide on a small project which could possibly be made in a few days. Ideas could be things like a to-do app, calculator, time tracker or similar. Doing something silly and/or fun is encouraged!

Scope & Estimate

Break the project down into component parts and detail the scope of features. Estimate the project components. Please submit the estimate and scope before starting work on the prototype.

MVP

Build a prototype. Don't worry about building a complete project - but try and stick to your initial scope.
Please keep track of how much time you end up spending on each component part. It does not matter if this is close to the estimated time - this is just to have a close-to-real experience of a project.

## Project Idea
I will work on a small pokemon battle game using the [PokeApi public API](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Scope & Estimate
So, the idea would be to choose a Pokemon to use and another one to fight (list should come from the API). Then, after choosing both Pokemon the battle starts, each Pokemon will have Health (HP) and an attack list.

In a more feature rich version there could be Items (like health potion, antidote, etc) and the ability to change Pokemon.

App Structure:
  - Pokemon Selection Screen
    - Selection Menu
    - Pokemon Preview Image (from API)
    - Start Battle button
  - Battle
    - Show Pokemon
    - Health data
    - Attack options 

The game will consist of the player (you) choosing an Attack and then the opponent responding with another attack. Who attacks first will be chosen based on Pokemon Speed stat (from API)

All of this should be done in approx 3 to 5 hours, depending on how many details I'll add.

## MVP

Here will be all the information related to the actual implementation, like if anything is missing or caveats.
